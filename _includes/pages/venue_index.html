  <p>Kochi, also known as Cochin (KO-chin), is a major port city on the south west coast of India by the Arabian Sea and is part of the district of Ernakulam in the state of Kerala.</p>
  <p>Known as the Queen of the Arabian Sea, Kochi was an important spice trading centre on the west coast of India from the 14th century</p>
  <p>Look for spicy dishes flavoured with tamarind and coconut in Kochi, and donâ€™t be surprised if your dinner is served up on a banana leaf. The region is a major banana-growing area, and traditional Kochi cuisine employs the fruit in many dishes, both sweet and savoury. Coconut water provides a refreshing and sweet contrast to the piquant food. </p>
