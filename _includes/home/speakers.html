                      Vagmi mostly spends his time writing code in various programming languages. Although he fantasises writing beautiful functional code in Haskell or Clojure, he spends most of his time hacking together stuff in Javascript, Swift, Java and Ruby. He can often be seen in conferences and meetups boring people to tears by talking about the software craftsmanship and how User Interfaces should behave as pure functions of the underlying state.

                       Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto is a programmer, and the creator of the Ruby language. He works for many open source related organizations and companies, e.g. NaCl inc. in Japan, Heroku and Ruby Association. Since his real name is difficult for non-Japanese speakers to pronounce correctly, he uses the nickname Matz on the Net.
